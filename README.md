# ASCII
A collection of my image to ASCII conversion python scripts.
ascii.py - Takes an input image and outputs the image converted to ASCII characters.
ascii_threaded.py - The same as ascii.py but uses threading to try to speed up the process of converting the image to ASCII.
ascii_video.py - Converts a live feed from the webcam into ASCII frame by frame.
