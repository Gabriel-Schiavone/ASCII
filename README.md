# ASCII
A collection of my image to ASCII conversion python scripts. The first of these scripts is ascii.py which simply takes an input image and converts it to an ASCII representation of the image. The next script is ascii_threaded.py in which I used threading to try to make it run faster. The last script is ascii_video.py which converts a live feed from the webcam into ASCII characters frame by frame. All three of these scripts output to the command prompt.
